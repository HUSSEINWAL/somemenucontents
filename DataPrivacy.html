      <li>You can delete your posts, stories, or comments at any time.</li>
      <li>Your private messages remain confidential and are not visible to other users.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain user data only for as long as necessary to provide app functionality, maintain security, or comply with legal requirements.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Deleted accounts and content are typically removed from our servers within <strong>30 days</strong>.</li>
      <li>Backup copies may persist briefly for recovery and safety before permanent deletion.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <hr />

    <h2>7. Compliance and Governance</h2>
    <p>We follow global data protection laws and frameworks such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)</strong> — for users in the EU/EEA.</li>
      <li><strong>CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)</strong> — for users in California.</li>

    </ul>

    <hr />
    <h2>Children Privacy, Data Protection & Social Exposure</h2>
    <p>
      Children’s social‑media accounts are default to private or friends-only mode; default public exposure significantly increases risk of unwanted contact or content exposure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Minimize data collection: only essential identity or profile information should be shared; geolocation, contact lists, and metadata should be restricted or made visible only to parents/guardians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Encryption and secure communications: apps should use encrypted transmission and secure storage of data; parents should keep device software and security patches up to date.
    </p>
    <p>
      Educate children about digital footprints: everything posted, shared, or commented may persist, be searchable, or be archived. Teach them the implications of oversharing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parents should review who can tag or mention their child, who can send direct messages, and whether the child’s profile appears in public search results. <span class="citation">Better Internet for Kids</span>
